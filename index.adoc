= That Multiverse
Wei Tang <wei@that.world>

[quote, Paul McAuley, Eveningâ€™s Empires]
The multiverse, she said, was like an old library whose shelves were packed with
books arranged by a cataloguing system that ranked them according to similarity,
each book containing within its covers a story that varied only slightly from
the stories of its immediate neighbours, but by increasing degrees from those of
increasingly distant books.

Here are illusions, dreams and imaginations in the form of science fictions,
essays, computer arts and algorithmic music. Each of them has its unique rules
and settings. Those multiverses are mainly maintained by Wei Tang.
